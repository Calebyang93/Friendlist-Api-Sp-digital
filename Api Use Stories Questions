1. As a user, I need an API to create a friend connection between two email addresses.
Problems in JSon Code could be something like error in string value for web domain. The email addresses are not valid. 

{
  friends:
    [
      'tim@email.co'
      'nick@email.co'
    ]
}

{
  friends:
    [
      'tim123email.co'
      'nick129email.co'
    ]
}

2. As a user, I need an API to retrieve the friends list for an email address.

Problems include the email address not valid
The problem include 
{
  email: 'tim123@emai.com'
}
 or 
 {
 email: 'hank@123mail.co'
The API will return this error 

{
  "success": false ,
  "friends" :
    [
      'tim123@emai.com'
    ],
  "count" : null   
}

3. As a user, I need an API to retrieve the common friends list between two email addresses.

Problems include that the email address is not valid based on string or character differences. 
{
  "success": false ,
  "friends" :
    [
      'Email address not valid'
    ],
  "error": tim@123emai.co is not valid.
  
}

4. As a user, I need an API to subscribe to updates from an email address.

Please note that "subscribing to updates" is NOT equivalent to "adding a friend connection".
Errors: Invalid requestor or target email address
{
  "requestor": "jennifer.z}@fastmail.com",
  "target": "tim@email.com"
}

api return as follows
{
"success": false
}

or 


{
  "requestor": "jennifer.z@fastmail.com",
  "target": "tim@email.1"
}

api return as follows
{
"success": false
}

5. As a user, I need an API to block updates from an email address.

Suppose "andy@example.com" blocks "john@example.com":

if they are connected as friends, then "andy" will no longer receive notifications from "john"
if they are not connected as friends, then no new friends connection can be added.

Errors include such api code
{
  "requestor": "andy@em1il.com",
  "target": "john@example.com"
}

which returns such api result 
{
"success": false,
}


or 
{
"requestor": "andy@email.com",
"target": "tom@ema!l.com"
}

which returns such api result 
{
"success": false,

6. 6. As a user, I need an API to retrieve all email addresses that can receive updates from an email address.

Eligibility for receiving updates from i.e. "john@example.com":

- has not blocked updates from "john@example.com", and
- at least one of the following:
- has a friend connection with "john@example.com"
- has subscribed to updates from "john@example.com"
- has been @mentioned in the update

Ineligibility Conditions : 
1. updates blocked from john@eexample.com or 
2. has not blocked updates from john@example.com and no friend connection with john@example.com  
3. has not blocked updates from john@example.com and have not subscription to updates from john@example.com
4. has not blocked updates from john@example.com and not been @mentioned in the update. 

Such API errors can happen as a result of ineglibility conditions
{
  "sender":  "john@example.com",
  "update": This is what happened today!
}
Such Api errors can happen :

{
  "success": false
  "invalid email recipients": "joe@example.com", "sally@example.com"  
    
}
